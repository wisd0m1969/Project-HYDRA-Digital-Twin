*From In-Silico AI Discovery to Mission-Critical Reality.*

</div>

<br>

> **Note to Investors & Contributors:** This repository contains the **Deterministic Digital Twin (Telemetry Simulation)** of Project HYDRA. It is designed to visualize the hardware capabilities and AI-reasoning loops before our physical IoT deployment in Sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Thailand.

## 🌍 The Genesis: Discovered by PROMETHEUS AGI
Project HYDRA was not invented by human engineers alone. It was autonomously synthesized by **PROMETHEUS**, our proprietary GraphRAG engine that maps over 14,000+ global patents and scientific papers. By traversing cross-domain knowledge graphs, the AI discovered an unpatented "Missing Link" combining *Materials Science*, *Biotechnology*, and *IoT Diagnostics* to solve **UN SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation)**.

## 🏛️ System Architecture: The Three Layers

HYDRA operates completely off-grid, utilizing a triad of advanced technologies:

### 1. ☀️ HELIOS (Solar Purification Core)
* **Tech:** Nanofiber-impregnated Graphene Aerogel.
* **Function:** Passive solar still that simultaneously desalinates and photodegrades organic pollutants without electricity.
* **Telemetry Tracked:** Solar Irradiance ($W/m^2$), Desalination Output ($L/hr$).

### 2. 🦠 AEGIS (Biological Defense Membrane)
* **Tech:** Nanobiocatalytic membranes with Quorum-Quenching agents.
* **Function:** Destroys antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and actively prevents biofilm formation by disrupting bacterial communication.
* **Telemetry Tracked:** Membrane Integrity (%), Biofouling Risk (%), Quorum-Quenching Status.

### 3. 💧 SENTINEL (IoT Diagnostic Network)
* **Tech:** Power-free, printable biosensors (ESP32-based for prototyping).
* **Function:** Real-time continuous monitoring of water output to ensure WHO-standard safety.
* **Telemetry Tracked:** pH Levels, Turbidity (NTU), Heavy Metal traces (PPM).

**Architecture Principles:**
- Unidirectional data flow: `engine.step()` → `HydraState` (immutable) → `history.append()` → `components.render()`
- All state objects are frozen dataclasses with `__post_init__` physics clamping
- Every component function is stateless: `(data) → go.Figure | str`
- Zero side effects in engine layer; zero business logic in UI layer
